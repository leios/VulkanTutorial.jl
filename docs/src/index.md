# Vulkan Tutorial (.jl)

This documentation is meant as a (relatively) simple guide to Vulkan through Julia.
My hope is to keep it as accessible as possible such that Julia users without a deep knowledge of GPU architecture or programming can still follow along and begin to implement whatever they want with Vulkan.

Though we will attempt to follow a similar path to [this Vulkan tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/), it is likely that we will reorder the lessons and also take a few pit-stops along the way so that our guide is more suitable for people in the Julia community.
